        <h3>Little things about me</h3>
        <p>
           Recently, I started watching Downton Abbey - it started from the curiosity about how the early 19c art-style was implemented. But I began to get interested how the writer Julian Fellow weaved and contructed the stories by infusing the contemporary social values.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I like classical music, Mozart's piano sonata and J.S. Bach's Cello suits. I love the structure of the work, neatly arranged with some unconventional variations. I like listening their works because they are boring, in other words, because they are not disturbing my mind - especially my life itself troubles me too much with out-of-control moments.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can use the same shortcut to edit other things as well - like functions in JavaScript,
            colors, and animation timing functions - and we're adding more and more all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the books that influence my perspective of life is Illusion by Richard Bach. It was about a pilot's journey in Indiana - I didn't expect that I would live close to the area that the novel is backgrounded. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I like hot and spicy food - please let me know if you want some too, I would love to share some of my cooking.
        </p>

            White is my favorite color. It can make all other colors less aggressive. It rejects all the color spectrum, so to remain pure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When I feel down, I would run - play the cello -

        <p>
           I have many pineapple trees. Simply because I couldn't discard the tops of pineapple whenever I cut it - soak it into the water to get roots.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What makes my life happy? Absolutely my kids and <a>students </a>.
